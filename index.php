     * 1. Define a function that contains two numbers.
     * 2. Add those numbers to compute a total.
     * 3. Print the result into the HTML page.
     *
     * The comments below explain each section so the script is easier to follow.

        // Store the second number used in the calculation.

        $sum = $num1 + $num2;

    // addNumbers();

    /*
    When the line above stays commented, no duplicate result is printed.
    Only the single active call below runs, so the sum appears once.

    Execute the function once so the result is displayed on the page.
    If the following line were commented out, the function would not run at all,
    and no output would be shown.
